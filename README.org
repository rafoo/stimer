* Description
STimer is a timer for Emacs. It aims at providing a very simple interface for precision time measure.

* Installation
To install STimer, put all the files in a directory (let call it D) and add the following lines to your Emacs configuration file (.emacs):

#+Begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "<D>")
  (require 'stimer)
#+End_src

STimer can then be invoqued by the command =stimer=; inside Emacs type =M-x stimer <RET>=.

You should switch to a new Buffer =*STimer*= presenting the timer count (set to 0 at startup).
You can get a list of commands by typing =h= or =?=, the usefull ones are
 * =s=: start a timer
 * =c=: start a countdown timer for 15 seconds

To stop the timer, you can press any standard key (even =s= or =c= if you want to immediatly restart a timer)
or press or release any mouse button.

* Speedcube timer
Stimer comes with a speedcube timer called "cube" (until I find a better name). It can be installed in a similar way to STimer:

#+Begin_src emacs-lisp
  (add-to-list 'load-path "<D>")
  (require 'cube)
#+End_src

The speedcube timer can be invoqued with the command =cube=; inside Emacs type =M-x cube <RET>=.
This command will switch to two buffers: the Stimer buffer and a buffer for speedcube informations.
